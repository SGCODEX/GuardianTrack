# GuardianTrack: AI-Powered Hazardous Cargo Management

## Overview

GuardianTrack is a Python-based simulation of an AI agent designed to manage the handling and tracking of hazardous materials within an airport logistics environment.  It provides a simplified model for classifying cargo, tracking its location, and displaying this information on a basic text-based map.

## Features

* **Cargo Management:** The `Cargo` class represents individual cargo items with attributes like ID, type, location, and hazard level.
* **Airport Simulation:** The `Airport` class manages cargo items within a simulated airport environment, including their locations and movements.
* **Hazard Identification:** The `identify_hazard()` function simulates the process of identifying hazardous materials based on cargo type.  (Note: This is a simplified example and should be replaced with a more robust method in a real-world application.)
* **Location Tracking:** The `update_location()` function simulates the movement of cargo within the airport.
* **Map Display:** The `display_map()` function provides a basic text-based visualization of the airport layout and cargo locations.

## Technical Architecture

The project consists of the following key components:

* **`Cargo` Class:**
    * Attributes: `cargo_id`, `cargo_type`, `location`, `hazard_label`
    * Methods: `__init__()`, `__str__()`, `update_location()`
* **`Airport` Class:**
    * Attributes: `name`, `cargo_list`, `layout` (for the simplified map)
    * Methods: `__init__()`, `add_cargo()`, `get_cargo_by_id()`, `identify_hazard()`, `update_location()`, `display_map()`, `get_cargo_location()`
* **`main()` Function:** Sets up the simulation, creates cargo and airport instances, simulates cargo movement, and displays the results.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x
2.  **Installation:** No special installation is required for this basic simulation.  You can clone the repository and run the Python script.
3.  **Running the Simulation:**
    * Save the `guardian_track.py` file.
    * Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
    * Run the script using: `python guardian_track.py`

## Code Explanation

See the comments within the `guardian_track.py` file for a detailed explanation of the code.

## Future Improvements

This is a basic simulation and can be expanded in several ways:

* **Implement Computer Vision:** Replace the simplified `identify_hazard()` function with actual computer vision techniques (e.g., using OpenCV and TensorFlow) to recognize hazard labels from images or video streams.
* **Integrate Mapping Service:** Use a mapping API (e.g., Google Maps) to display cargo locations on a real map, providing a more user-friendly interface.
* **Enhance Routing and Optimization:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms for optimizing cargo routing and storage within the airport, potentially using techniques like A\* search or other pathfinding algorithms.
* **Incorporate Sensor Data:** Integrate data from real-world sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, gas detectors) to monitor cargo conditions and trigger alerts in case of emergencies.
* **Database Integration:** Use a database to store and retrieve cargo information, allowing for persistence and scalability.
* **GUI Development:** Create a graphical user interface
