# GuardianTrack: An AI Agent for Intelligent and Secure Hazardous Cargo Management in Airport Logistics

Core Functionality:
    -   Simulates the identification and tracking of hazardous cargo at an airport.
    -   Uses a simplified model to classify cargo based on simulated labels.
    -   Displays cargo location on a basic, text-based map (for demonstration).

Technical Architecture:
    -   Classes:
        -   Cargo: Represents a cargo item with attributes like ID, type, location, and hazard level.
        -   Airport: Manages cargo, their locations, and provides methods to track and display them.
    -   Functions:
        -   identify_hazard(): A simplified function to simulate hazard identification using keyword matching.
        -   update_location(): Simulates cargo movement within the airport.
        -   display_map(): A very basic text-based map display.

Future Improvements:
    -   Implement actual computer vision for label recognition (OpenCV, TensorFlow).
    -   Integrate with a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps API) for a graphical display.
    -   Add more sophisticated routing and storage optimization.
    -   Incorporate real sensor data for monitoring cargo conditions.
